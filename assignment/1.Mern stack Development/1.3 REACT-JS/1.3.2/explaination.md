Application Overview
BlogPostList Component
The BlogPostList component is a functional component responsible for rendering a list of blog posts. It receives a posts prop, an array of blog post objects, and displays their titles, authors, and a "View Full Post" button. The styling is defined in the associated index.css file.

App Component
The App component is a class component that manages the application's state, including the loading status and blog posts. It fetches dummy blog post data after a delay to simulate a real-world scenario. The loading state is used to display a loading message while the data is being fetched. Once the data is loaded, the BlogPostList component is rendered with the fetched blog posts.

Usage
To integrate this application into your project:

Copy the contents of BlogPostList/index.js into your BlogPostList component file.
Copy the contents of App.js into your App component file.
Ensure the associated CSS files (index.css and App.css) are included in your project.
This setup provides a basic structure for a blog post listing application in React. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements.
