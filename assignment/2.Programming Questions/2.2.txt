Q)Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. Provide examples of use cases for each.

A)
->SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL  are two different types of database systems that are used for storing data.

     (i) SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language for defining and manipulating the data. They are table-based and are a good fit for applications with complex transactions and row-oriented operations. 

           Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, etc.

            Use cases for SQL databases:
                 - Banking systems where transactions need to be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).
                  - Applications that require multi-row transactions like accounting systems 
                  -  systems that were designed around a relational model.

      (ii) NoSQL databases on the other hand, are non-relational databases that can store and retrieve data in a variety of ways, not just via tables. NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. They are a good fit for applications with large amounts of data. 
            
              Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB etc.

              Use cases for NoSQL databases:
                       - Real-time analytics and IoT applications.
                        - Applications dealing with large amounts of data with little to no structure.
                        - Rapid development of applications with evolving data requirements.

so, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends largely on the specific requirements of the application you are developing. SQL is generally a good choice for applications requiring complex queries and transaction reliability, while NoSQL is better for applications requiring scalability and speed with large amounts of unstructured data.
