QUESTION:check wheather a string is palindrome or not

ANS)LANGUAGE: Python
   

n = input()  # To Take User Input

x = n[::-1]  # As STRING IS IMMUTABLE, WE HAVE TO REVERSE A STRING AND STORE IN VARIABLE X

if x == n:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not Palindrome")


/*Palindrome is nothing but if you reverse a string it should be same as original string */
